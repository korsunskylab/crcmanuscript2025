# Spatial analysis of human colorectal tumors reveals organized immune hubs at the stromal/epithelial interface

This repository contains the analysis code used to generate the figures in the manuscript *”Spatial analysis of human colorectal tumors reveals organized immune hubs at the stromal/epithelial interface.”*

The repository is organized by figure and includes representative notebooks illustrating the analytical workflows used in the study. It is not intended to be a fully automated end-to-end reproduction pipeline for all datasets.
