    "# Spatial Analysis of Cell Proximity to Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook analyzes the spatial distribution of different cell types relative to defined biological interfaces. The primary goal is to determine if certain cell types are enriched or depleted near specific types of interfaces (e.g., 'hub positive' vs. 'hub negative').\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow consists of several key stages:\n",
    "1.  **Function Definitions**: A collection of R functions for performing the core statistical analysis, including distance calculations, empirical Bayes shrinkage, and meta-analysis.\n",
    "2.  **Data Loading & Preprocessing**: Loading cell spatial coordinates and interface geometries from external files.\n",
    "3.  **Distance Calculation**: For each cell, calculating the distance to the nearest interface and classifying it by interface type.\n",
    "4.  **Statistical Analysis**: Applying a meta-analysis across multiple samples to get robust estimates of cell type proportions at different distances from the interfaces.\n",
    "5.  **Visualization**: Generating plots to visualize the results and compare cell distributions between different interface types."

    "### **1. Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this analysis is to quantify and compare the spatial distribution of specific cell types (and broader lineages) relative to biological interfaces (Tumor-Stromal boundaries). It specifically seeks to determine if certain cell populations are enriched or depleted at specific distances from \"Hub-positive\" versus \"Hub-negative\" interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Data Processing Pipeline**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Input Data:** The method uses single-cell spatial data (cell coordinates, cell type annotations) and geometric data defining the interfaces (lines separating tumor and stroma).\n",
    "* **Distance Calculation:** For every cell in a sample, the algorithm calculates the Euclidean distance to the nearest interface line.\n",
    "* **Sign Assignment:** Distances are signed to distinguish between the two sides of the interface:\n",
    "* **Negative Distances:** Assigned to cells in \"Stromal-enriched\" regions.\n",
    "* **Positive Distances:** Assigned to cells in the opposing (Tumor) regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Binning:** Cells are grouped into **5µm spatial bins** spanning from -100µm (deep stroma) to +100µm (deep tumor).\n",
    "* **Counting:** The number of cells of each specific type (e.g., `Tcd8-CXCL13`) or lineage (e.g., `Myeloid`) is counted within each bin for each interface type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Statistical Methodology**\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a hierarchical statistical framework to handle noise and biological variability across samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step A: Empirical Bayes Shrinkage (Per Sample)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Raw proportions in spatial bins can be noisy, especially for rare cell types or bins with few total cells. To address this, the method uses **Empirical Bayes shrinkage**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It models cell counts using a Binomial distribution.\n",
    "* It estimates a **Beta prior** (parameters \\alpha, \\beta) from the data itself using the method of moments.\n",
    "* It calculates \"shrunken\" estimates of proportions, pulling extreme or unstable estimates from small sample sizes toward the global mean. This results in more robust estimates of cell abundance in each spatial bin for each sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step B: Meta-Analysis (Global Aggregation)**\n",
    "\n",
    "To combine results across multiple patients/samples, the method uses an **Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW) meta-analysis**, implemented via the `ashr` (Adaptive Shrinkage) package.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This aggregates the per-sample estimates and variances into a single global estimate and variance for each spatial bin.\n",
    "* This approach ensures that samples with more precise estimates (more cells) contribute more to the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step C: Hypothesis Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare conditions (e.g., Hub+ vs. Hub- interfaces), the method performs statistical tests on the aggregated meta-analysis results:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Welch's t-test:** Used to compare the means of the two groups at each spatial bin.\n",
    "* **Log2 Fold Change (LFC):** Calculated to quantify the magnitude of difference between the groups.\n",
    "* **FDR Correction:** P-values are adjusted for multiple comparisons using the False Discovery Rate (FDR) method. Significance is generally defined as `padj < 0.01`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Specific Analyses Performed**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cell State Analysis:** Analyzes specific cell subsets (e.g., `Tcd8-CXCL13`, `Myeloid-ISG`) to see how specific phenotypes pattern spatially.\n",
    "2. **Lineage Analysis:** Groups cells into broad categories (TNKILC, Myeloid, Stromal, Epi, etc.) to see macro-level tissue architectural changes.\n",
    "3. **Interface Comparisons:**\n",
    "* **Hub+ vs. Hub-:** Compares interfaces defined by CXCL13+ (Hub) vs. CXCL13- (Non-Hub) status.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Visualization**\n",
    "\n",
    "The results are visualized as **line traces** where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **X-axis:** Distance from the interface (Stromal side to Epithelial side).\n",
    "* **Y-axis:** Percentage of all cells (or percentage of lineage) that belong to the cell type of interest.\n",
    "* **Ribbons/Error Bars:** Represent the 95% Confidence Interval derived from the meta-analysis variance.\n",
    "* **Asterisks:** Indicate spatial bins where the difference between conditions is statistically significant."
