# Figure 5 — Spatial Colocalization and Neighborhood Composition

This directory contains analyses quantifying spatial colocalization of tissue regions and immune structures.

---

## Colocalization Analysis

`colocalization_in_immune_structures.ipynb`

Performs spatial enrichment analyses around defined interfaces and regions.

---

## Neighborhood Composition

`figure5b_barplot.ipynb`

Generates neighborhood composition summaries corresponding to Figure 5B and related supplementary panels.

---

### Execution Notes

These analyses build on:
- Region assignments from Figure 3
- Interface definitions from Figure 4
